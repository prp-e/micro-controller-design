			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				I always wanted to design a micro-controller or micro-processor, so I managed to model them. Now, I've decided to show people how a micro-controller is designed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm inspired by the book I've read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/But-How-Know-Principles-Computers/dp/0615303765">But How Do It Know? - The Basic Principles of Computer for Everyone</a> by <b>J. Clark Scott</b> and also studied MIPS, ARM and PowerPC architectures. So, in this book, I try to simplify a micro-processor and turn it to a micro-controller. 
			</p>
			<p id="Audience">
				<h3>Audience</h3>
				Of course you should be geek enough to read this book. Although I try to simplify topics,
				but if you have knowledge of logical circuits or micro processors,
				you'll understand this book easier. 
			</p>
			<p id="what_will_we_learn">
				<h3>What will we learn?</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						You'll understand how mankind communicated with machines for years
						& the way people communicated with computers didn't change.
					</li>
					<li>
						You start learning <i>Logical Circuits</i> which is base of computer architecture and organization.
							<p style="font-size: 70%;">
								importance of <i>Logical Circuits</i> knowledge is undeniable.
								<br>
								In all universities (at least Iran's) you must pass <i>Logical Circuits</i>
								course before taking <i>Computer Architecture</i> course.
							</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Once we learned <i>Logical Circuits</i>, we'll start to design simple circuits and even, computers, memory blocks, etc!
					</li>
					<li>
						We'll combine everything we had previously designed and that will be our computer!
					</li>
					<li>
					Finaly, we can program our computer, and we actually understood how a computer can understand human language.

				<h2>What is a "micro-controller"?</h2>
				A micro-controller is a small computer, usually <i>System on Chip (SoC)</i> which includes:
				<ul>
					<li>a processor core</li>
					<li>memory unit</li>
					<li>prgrammble I/O unit</li>
				</ul>
				The most famous family of micro-controllers is <i>AVR</i> (stands for: <i>Advanced Virtual RISC</i>). This family of micro-controllers are used in some educational boards (eg. <a href="https://arduino.cc">Arduino</a>) and are generally used for educational and industrial purposes.
				<br>
				A micro-controller is the brain of either a simple toy car or a U.S.A.F. drone (and more) depending on its type and the program we've written.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>What does a microcontroller consist of??</h3>
				In this section, I only explain process core, and in other chapters, we'll study other parts such as memory unit and I/O system.
				<ol>
					The process core is usually made up of:
					<li>
						<h5>Arithmetic and Logical Unit (ALU)</h5>
						<p>
							This unit, does every logical and arithmetic operation. It's the most important part of a microcontroller. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>Data Bus</h5>
						<p>
							This part is simply a bunch of wires which transfer data between two/different parts of process core. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h5>Registers</h5>
						<p>
							Registers are small memory blocks. They can store data temporarily and transfer them. We always need registers, because they're our temporary memory blocks and while we run a program, we need to store inputs and outputs.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>But, How does it know?! ... </h3>
				OK, now let's talk about <i>How does even a computer know what we want?</i>
				The answer is quite simple! for instance, when we write the following x86 family Assemby code:
				<pre>
					<code>
						<p>
MOV DX, OFFSET MSG
MOV AH, 09
INT 21H
						</p>
					</code>
We assemble and run the code. it shows a message (e.g. <code class="sgl">Hello World!</code>).
				</pre>
				To Imagine: You're a tourist in Iran, you can understand Iranians by speaking Persian,
				And Iranians can also communicate you in Persian. So, if we consider each computer a foreigner, we can communicate with them by Assembly language (Machine languages, preciser).
				It's computers' language and we need to communicate with it in its own language.
				<p>
					 In this book, you'll find how can we generate a simple machine language, and we can do simple projects with our small computer, and enjoy!
				</p>
			</p>
		</span>
	</div>
	<div id="chapter2">
		<h2>How to talk to computer?</h2>
		<p>
			In previous chapter, we talked about how a computer can understand us. In this chapter, we learn how to communicate with our computer, and how to command it.
			<pre>
Let's take a look at a common *programming language*, for example, C++:
				<code>
					<p>
<span style="color: crimson;">#include</span> &lt;iostream.h&gt;
<span style="color: crimson;">using namespace</span> std;

<span style="color: crimson;">int</span> main(){
 cout << <span style="color: green;">"Hello, World!"</span> << endl;
 <span style="color: crimson;">return</span> 0;
}
					</p>
				</code>
This is called a program and when we *compile* it, it turns to a file, usually named <code class="sgl">a.out</code>.
Let's run our program:
				<code>
					<p>
~:$ ./a.out
Hello, World!
~:$
					</p>
				</code>
			</pre>
			And now, we've communicated with our computer, but in a language similiar to ours.
			This kind of programming languages are called <b>High Level</b> languages. They're close to human language, and they're easy to learn.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a lot of high level languages such as <i>C++</i>, <i>Python</i>, <i>Ruby</i>, <i>Go</i>, etc. We use them when we need.
			For example, for coding a school project you may use C, or Go and to code a commercial project, you may use python, as it's easy to learn
			and also have a lot of libraries.
		</p>
		<p>
			But, what if you want to talk (code) directly to your hardware?! Now, we need a language which is close to machines'. 
		</p>
		<div id="machine_code">
			<h3>The Machine Code</h3>
			<p>
				Machines are awesome, because they only use 0 and 1 to communicate with each other.
				Humans are not as smart as computers in this case. we use a lots of letters/(phonemes in conversation) in daily communications.
				English includes 26 letters, Persian includes 32 letters, and there are languages with more than 100 letters.
				Computers have only two letters, <code class="sgl">0</code> and <code class="sgl">1</code>. Now, let's take a look at these letters!
			</p>
			<div id="everything_binary">
				<h4>Everything binary</h4>
				<p>
					OK, we told you there is two letters in machine language. So, we need to convert usual letters and numbers to words that computer can understand.
					We use <b>base 2</b> as a key to machine language. In base 10 - the regular format of daily mathematics - we have digits 0 through 9, but in base 2, we have only 0 and 1.
					Every digit here is called a <i>binary digit</i> , or in short, a <b>bit</b>. But a single bit alone is not enough for us. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="word_size">
				<h4>Word size</h4>
				<p>
					Imagine the word "Hello" in English language. It has 4 characters. Also, 
					imagine the number "42", it has 2 digits. In computers, we need a fixed size,
					and each word can't be bigger or smaller than that. We call this fixed space <b>word size</b>.
					We need word size to compute carry digit, overflow and underflow, etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the most popular word sizes, is a <b>byte</b>, which is made up of 8 bits.
					A simple byte is mapped like this:
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>7</td>
							<td>6</td>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>4</td>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Now, we initialized one byte using only zeros, but, we have two forms for a bit, zero or one.
					So, how can we convert a binary number to a decimal one?!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="convertion">
				<h4>Conversion, It's easy</h4>
				<p>
					Now, let's take a look at a simple binary number (e.g. <code class="sgl">1001</code>).
					This number is a 4 bit one, but we defined our word size 8 bits.
				</p>
				<p>
				In order to convert it to an 8 bit number, we just need to replace missing bits with zeros:
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>1</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Now, we know column 3 and column 0 have value one, it's so easy to calculate the decimal value:
				<br><code class="sgl" title="caret/circumflex^ mark means power">2^3 + 2^1 = 8 + 1 = 9</code>
				</p>
				<p>
					It's fine to convert binary numbers to decimal, but how can we convert a decimal number to binary?
					<br>let's try to convert 135 to binary. We all know 135 is equal to <code class="sgl">128 + 7</code>.
					<p>
						So, we can write this number like: 
						<code class="sgl">2^7 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0</code>
					</p>
					So, we shall enter 1 in columns 7, 2, 1 and 0. Our result is just like this:
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>7</td>
							<td>6</td>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>4</td>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					And Yes! 10000111 is our result.
				</p>
					<p>
						But there's a question, is there any other format(s) to communicate with computers? Yes! We can use base 16, too.
						base 16 is known as hexadecimal, and we have digits 0 through F in that format. It's weird, isn't it?
					</p>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="hexadecimal_world_welcomes_you">
				<h4>Hexadecimal world welcomes you</h4>
				<p>
					Now, let's talk about digits. In base 10, we have 10 digits, In base 3, we have 3 digits, 
					but what about 16? In base 16 we have 16 digits. But how can we code our digits? 
					It's so easy, we use Latin letters instead of numbers.
					<table>
					This table, shows you a simple convertion among binary, decimal and hexadecimal:
						<thead id="convertion_comparision_table_bin_dec_hex">
							<td>Binary</td>
							<td>Decimal</td>
							<td>Hexadecimal</td>
						</thead>
						<tr>
							<td>0000</td>
							<td>00</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0001</td>
							<td>01</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>

						</tr>
						<tr>

							<td>4</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0101</td>
							<td>05</td>
							<td>5</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0110</td>
							<td>06</td>
							<td>6</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0111</td>
							<td>07</td>
							<td>7</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1000</td>
							<td>08</td>
							<td>8</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1001</td>
							<td>09</td>
							<td>9</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1010</td>
							<td>10</td>
							<td>A</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1011</td>
							<td>11</td>
							<td>B</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1100</td>
							<td>12</td>
							<td>C</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1101</td>
							<td>13</td>
							<td>D</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1110</td>
							<td>14</td>
							<td>E</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1111</td>
							<td>15</td>
							<td>F</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					These are our digits.
				</p>
				<p>
					We learned from this table that every 4 bit is equal to one hex digit. 
					So, we can convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal one using this table, 
					and our knowledge of binary calculations. Let's think about <code class="sgl">158</code>.
					<br> 158 is <code class="sgl">128 + 30</code>. So, We can write this number like this:
					<pre>
						<code>
							<p>
2^7 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1
							</p>
						</code>
					</pre>
					And now, we can draw binary conversion table for this number like this:
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>7</td>
							<td>6</td>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>4</td>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Oh, 10011110 is our result.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's convert it to hexadecimal! It has 8 bits, 
					it means it has 2 digits in hexadecimal format.
					<table>
						So, we draw a hexadecimal conversion table for this number:
						<tr>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1001</td>
							<td>1110</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</p>
				<p>
					According to the <a href="#convertion_comparision_table_bin_dec_hex">previous table</a>
					<code class="sgl">1001</code> is equal to 9 and <code class="sgl">1110</code> is qual to E. 
					So, our result is <code class="sgl">9E</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this sections, we learned about how computer sees data. 
					A computer reads data in binary format, 
					but we simplify it by showing binary numbers in hexadecimal, 
					and of course, we translate hexadecimal instructions for computer later.

			<h3>Mathematics?</h3>
			<p>
				We learned how to communicate with a computer, and now, 
				we need to know how to do arithmetic operations using a computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				In next chapter, we just take a look at how a computer can do arithmetic operations. 
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="chapter3">
		<h2>Arithmetic operations</h2>
		<p>
			We do simple arithmetic operations in our daily life.
			For example, when you buy a candy for $2 , and you give the seller $5 banknote, he will give you $3. 
			This is a simple subtraction we use in daily life. 
			Or, if you want to buy a toy car for $100, and you have $80 in your pocket, you may go to bank and you will take $20 from your account. 
			This is a simple addition and subtraction in daily life. But how a computer do that?! 
		</p>
		<p>
			In previous chapter, we talked about how computer reads data. 
			We talked about binary digits. 
			In this chapter, we take a look at/that addition and subtraction of them. 
		</p>
		<div id="addition_chapter3">
			<h3>Addition</h3>
			<p>
				How do you add two decimal numbers? for example 105 and 55. This is how we add these two numbers:
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>carry</th>
						<td></td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>number 1</th>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>5</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>+number2</th>
						<td></td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>5</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>result</th>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				We start from ones, then we add <b>carry</b> of ones to decimal. 
				<p>
				Now, we can do the same for 1100 and 0100. I know we have decided to use 8 bit word size, and so I've dran a 8 bits table:
				</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<!-- bits count -->
						<th>bit number</th>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>3</td>
						<td>2</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<!-- carries -->
						<th>carry</th>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<!-- first number -->
						<th>first number</th>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<!-- second number -->
						<th>second one</th>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<!-- result -->
						<th>result</th>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				Did you see, we used to empty bits for our carry.
			</p>
			<p>
				If we use a smaller word size, this carry can't be displayed in output, and that will result an error. 
				OK, we just did a simple addition. Let's talk about a bigger one, 11000000 and 01000000.
				<table>
					<tr>
						<!-- bits count -->
						<td>C</td>
						<td>7</td>
						<td>6</td>
						<td>5</td>
						<td>4</td>
						<td>3</td>

						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<!-- bits count -->
						<td>1</td>
						<td>1</td>

						<td></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<!-- bits count -->

						<td>1</td>
						<td>1</td>
						<td>0</td>

					</tr>
					<tr>

					</tr>
					<tr>

						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
						<td>0</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				In column <b>C</b>, we've stored our carry.
				This means, we need a word size bigger than 8 bits, if we care about the final result.
				But, currently we don't care about it, and we just store it in a memory block called 
				<b>Carry Flag</b>. we'll talk about it later.
			</p>
			<p>
				Addition in binary is very, very easy. 
				But, what about subtraction? we need a subtraction for our microcontroller, too. 
				But how can we implement our subtraction?
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="substraction_chap3">
			<h3>Subtraction</h3>
			<p>
				It's a bit difficult to do a subtraction in computers, because we have no subtraction circuit. 
				We have <i>Negator</i> and <i>Adder</i> instead of subtractor.
				So, we have different ways to make a number negative. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll show you three popular ways, and at the end, we choose on of them as our standard. 
			</p>
			<div id="sign_modulus_sys">
				<h4>Sign/Modulus System</h4>
				<p>
					In the first method, we have a sign bit, which is equal to the most valuable bit. 
					If it's 1, number is negative, and if it's 0, number is positive.
					<table>
						Let's see an example, for example we convert 36 and -66 to a <span title="Sign/Modulus">S/M</span> number:
						<thead>
							<td>Decimal</td>
							<td>Sign bit</td>
							<td>6</td>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>4</td>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</thead>
						<tr>
							<td>36</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>-66</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					Oh, let's think about this system. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This system is very easy-to-use, but have two great problems:
					<ol>
						<li>It makes our word size smaller, as one of our bits wasted.</li>
						<li>It makes negative zero condition, and we need to use algorithms designed for this system.</li>
					</ol>
					Algorithms to solve negative zero condition are not very popular, so we won't use S/M.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>One's complement</h4>
				<p>
					There's another easy way, and it's called <b>One's complement</b>, the second method. 
					<table>
						In this system, we just invert bits. 
						Every 0 becomes 1, and every 1 becomes 0. 
						Let's calculate -36 in this system:
						<thead>
							<td>Decimal</td>
							<td>7</td>
							<td>6</td>
							<td>5</td>
							<td>4</td>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</thead>
						<tr>
							<td>36</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>-36</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</p>
				<p>
					This system is much better than S/M. but still have a great problem. 
					It still makes negative zero, and it's not good for us. 
					So, we have a final solution!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Two's complement</h4>
				<p>
					Our final solution is the third (and last) method: <b>Two's complement</b>.
				</p>

					This system is very similar to one's complement, 
					but we just add 1 to one's complement, 
					and it makes two's complement for us. 
					<table>
						Let's calculate -67 in this system:

					In this system, we have no negative zero conditions, and all bits are used efficiently.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, we have chosen this system as our standard,

				<h4>How to Subtract?</h4>
				<p>
					OK, now we are able to make negative numbers. 
					So, a subtraction operation is simply <i>addition of a number, to a negative number</i>. 
					<pre>
So, for example:
						<code>
							<p>
125 - 36 <span style="color: gray;">is actually equivalent to</span> 125 + (-36)
							</p>
						</code>
					</pre>
					<table>
						So, first, we calculate -36:

							<td>Decimal</td>
							<td>7</td>

							<td>4</td>
							<td>3</td>
							<td>2</td>

					The carry is normal here, and every subtraction have one, 
					now, we can do every subtraction with this method.
				</p>
				<p>
					The carry has a role now, we call it <b>Sign Flag</b> 
					and when we want to design our final process core, 
					we will consider a bit for this bit, too.

				In next chapter, we'll learn logical operations, which are very important in every computer.

		<div id="what_should_we_do_chap3">
			<h3>Now, what should we do?</h3>
			<p>
				In our <i>process core</i> , we will use two's complement system as the main system. 
				Now, we need another type of operations, called <i>Logical Operations</i>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In next chapter, we'll learn logical operations, which are very important in every computer.

	<div id="chapter4">
		<h2>Logical Operations</h2>
		<p>
			Let's talk about logic! Do you know what logic is? 
			Logic is somekind of mathematics, mixed with philosophy in simple word. 
			It's started by Greek philosopher, <i>Aristotle</i>. Simply, logic says: 
 			<b>John is taller than Ali, Ali is taller than Ahmed, so, John is taller than Ahmed</b>. 
			This was a very, very simple example of a logical problem in our daily life. 
			We can do this example for everything measurable in our daily life, souch as area, height, weight, etc.
		</p>
		<div id="how_many_log_op_we_has">
			<h3>How many logical operations do we have?</h3>
			<p>
				We have some simple logics, and we review all of them here, and we solve some simple problems, and create new logics.
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4>NOT</h4>
				<p>
					As we have <i>binary</i> system, we use 0 for everything <b>off</b> and 1 for everything <b>on</b>. 
					0 for everything <b>true</b> and 1 for everything <b>false</b>. 
					So, here we have just one variable called <b>A</b>.
					<table>
						Let's do `NOT` operation on <b>A</b>!
						<thead>
							<td>NOT</td>
							<td>A</td>
							<td>~A</td>
						</thead>
						<tr>
							<td></td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>0</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					We show <code class="sgl">NOT A</code> in the form <code class="sgl">~A</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					This notation, helps us write <b>logical function</b>s. 
					<p>
						(Functions are operations we do on one or more variables, and
						it has unique answer per inputs from a bunch of variables.)
					</p>
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>AND</h4>
				<p>
					This operation, is very simple, but has two logic inputs.
					<table>
						The table of AND is like this:
						<thead>
							<td>AND</td>
							<td>A</td>
							<td>B</td>
							<td>Out</td>
						</thead>
						<tr>
							<td></td>
							<td>0</td>
							<td>0</td>

						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td></td>
							<td>1</td>

							<td>1</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					We show <code class="sgl">A AND B</code> in logical notation in the form <code class="sgl">AB</code>.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>OR</h4>
				<p>
					Of course, you remember famous question from Shakespear's novel Hamlet:
					<blockquote>To be, or not to be; this is the question!</blockquote>
					Now, we're going to explain what OR is.
					<table>
						This table can explain this operation
						<thead>
							<td>OR</td>

					One of operands need to be <b>True</b> and it makes whole answer <b>True</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					we show <code class="sgl">A OR B</code> in the form <code class="sgl">A+B</code>.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Truth Table</h3>
			<p>
				You saw, we used a table, which includes operation, operands and output. This table is called <b>Truth Table</b>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Let's play a game!</h3>
			<p>
				So, let's combine some logics and make new ones! The simplest ones are:
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4>NAND</h4>
				<p>
					It means <code class="sgl">~(AB)</code> - it's <code class="sgl">NOT(AND(A, B))</code> in simple words.
					<table>
						NAND Truth Table
						<thead>
							<td>NAND</td>
							<td>A</td>

			<div>
				<h4>NOR</h4>
				<p>
					It means <code class="sgl">~(A+B)</code> - it's <code class="sgl">NOT(OR(A, B))</code> in a simple word.
					<table>
						NOR Truth Table
						<thead>

					</table>
				</p>
				<p>
					Is there any more logics? of course yes! But, we will have a view on only two others, in this chapter. 
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Complex logics</h3>
			<p>
				There are to other logics, which are made from other logics, I would like to call them <i>"Complex
				Logic"</i>s because They're not as simple as AND or OR. Also, we can call them <i>"Exclusive Logic"</i>s. 
				This is what other engineers called them!  
			</p>
			<div>
				<h4>eXclusive OR</h4>
				<p>
					XOR is implemented as <code class="sgl">~AB + A~B</code>.

			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>eXclusive NOR</h4>
				<p>
					This logic is the same as XOR, but with a little difference!
					if you apply NOT function to XOR, you'll get XOR. However, the
					best implementation of XNOR is <code class="sgl">~A~B + AB</code>

			<h3>The Journey to Computer Architecture!</h3>
			<p>
				Now, we know logics, and we need to learn about <b>Logical Circuits</b>, 
				which are representation of these logics in computer science and electronics.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the next chapter, we will learn how to use and design simple logical circuits.
				After that, we'll start to design and implement our dear micro-controller.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course you must have read these chapters to learn the computer language.
				 but after learning the language, you need to know how a computer is built!
